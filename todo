X-when fading in after the game is done. it should stop fading in immediately (or fadeInNow afterwards)
x-fix collision area for basic tank
x-evade bullet
  -evade too aggressive, should account for the actual distance from the bullet
    -> faster tank can response later, slower tank might want to evade earlier.
x-Tiger tank explode, H and J not explode
x-player shot reload logic 

x-starting moves:
 -aim at player but quickly turn to trick player think it is aiming at it.
 -why if i don't shoot, enemy never shoot 

x- after dance, face player!

-approach should not try to get to player's exact position, but is keep a distance away and start shoot!


-bug: explode keep invisible

-Game Over/Got you!: add replay or go back to previous screen

-Tiger tank: basic enemy similar to your tank.
-railgun tank: long reload time, long range very accurate, fast bullet, slow movement and turn rate
-assault helicopter: move and turn fast. tends to stay at one point, can evade bullet really good
-jeep: move fast and move alot. long range very inaccurate, small bullet.
-fighter jet: can only shoot from long range, not really that accurate, move really fast.
