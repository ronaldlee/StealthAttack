X-when fading in after the game is done. it should stop fading in immediately (or fadeInNow afterwards)
x-fix collision area for basic tank
x-evade bullet
  -evade too aggressive, should account for the actual distance from the bullet
    -> faster tank can response later, slower tank might want to evade earlier.
x-Tiger tank explode, H and J not explode
x-player shot reload logic 
x-starting moves:
 -aim at player but quickly turn to trick player think it is aiming at it.
 -why if i don't shoot, enemy never shoot 
x- after dance, face player!
x-bug: explode keep invisible
x-disable landscape
x-bug: shoot multiple times at beginning!
x-or go back to previous screen
x-disable status bar
x-hide frame rate
x-singleplay: replay
x-bug: replay how come one tank's old position is still sending over?

-bug: after replay, the next time it doesn't game over/replay again
-bug: when one got hit, but the other doesn't. only one is gameover and the other is not!
-multiplay:Game Over/Got you!: add replay
  - when one choose replay but another one is 'back' already, invalid the replay
-multi play: back
-multi play: handle disconnect

- from title to battle stage fade in

-single play: score (winning %)
-multi play: score (winning %)

-add mobile ad
- tutorial
-multiplayer restrict 2 players
-4 players

-bug: multiplay iphone start sometimes crash
-bug: missing tank!? is the tankId default value missing?
-bug: first guy pick stealth, second guy also pick stealth. But first guy is visible, but not second guy!
- guessing should consider player's tank current rotation..
 - where the tank point to is more likely go there.

-when exploded, stop tank wheels movement.

-(minor)approach should not try to get to player's exact position, but is keep a distance away and start shoot!

Boss:
-Tiger tank: basic enemy similar to your tank.
-railgun tank: long reload time, long range very accurate, fast bullet, slow movement and turn rate
-assault helicopter: move and turn fast. tends to stay at one point, can evade bullet really good
-jeep: move fast and move alot. long range very inaccurate, small bullet.
-fighter jet: can only shoot from long range, not really that accurate, move really fast.
