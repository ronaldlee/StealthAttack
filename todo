X-when fading in after the game is done. it should stop fading in immediately (or fadeInNow afterwards)
x-fix collision area for basic tank
x-evade bullet
  -evade too aggressive, should account for the actual distance from the bullet
    -> faster tank can response later, slower tank might want to evade earlier.
x-Tiger tank explode, H and J not explode
x-player shot reload logic 
x-starting moves:
 -aim at player but quickly turn to trick player think it is aiming at it.

x-bug: replay how come one tank's old position is still sending over?
x-bug: after replay, the next time it doesn't game over/replay again
x-bug: when one got hit, but the other doesn't. only one is gameover and the other is not!
x-replay indicator: opp choose to rematch, when I choose replay, it change button bg color to white and font to black
x-multi play: select tank, 'ready' also need to change state to wait
x-replay need to notify opp that you want rematch
x(cant reproduce)-bug-after back, replay and tanks not moving and strange..
x-multiplay: when one choose replay but another one is 'back' already, invalid the replay
 -when i choose back, it will just go back. => send back noti to opp.
 -when opp chooses back, your 'replay' will be removed
x-multi play: back

- from title to battle stage fade in
-p2p connect: remove visible to others?, Browse for devices and Disconnect doesn't look like a button.


-multiplayer restrict 2 players
-4 players

-bug: crash??
-bug: multiplay iphone start sometimes crash
-bug: missing tank!? is the tankId default value missing?
-bug: first guy pick stealth, second guy also pick stealth. But first guy is visible, but not second guy!
- guessing should consider player's tank current rotation..
 - where the tank point to is more likely go there.

-when exploded, stop tank wheels movement.

-(minor)approach should not try to get to player's exact position, but is keep a distance away and start shoot!

-railgun tank: long reload time, long range very accurate, fast bullet, slow movement and turn rate
-assault helicopter: move and turn fast. tends to stay at one point, can evade bullet really good
-jeep: move fast and move alot. long range very inaccurate, small bullet.
-fighter jet: can only shoot from long range, not really that accurate, move really fast.
