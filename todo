X-when fading in after the game is done. it should stop fading in immediately (or fadeInNow afterwards)
x-fix collision area for basic tank
x-evade bullet
  -evade too aggressive, should account for the actual distance from the bullet
    -> faster tank can response later, slower tank might want to evade earlier.
-starting moves:
 -aim at player but quickly turn to trick player think it is aiming at it.
-why if i don't shoot, enemy never shoot 
x-Tiger tank explode, H and J not explode
